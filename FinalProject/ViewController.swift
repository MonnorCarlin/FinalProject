The bottom buttons, Sneak, Speech, and Strength, are your combat actions. Sneak normally does less damage, but has a higher chance of hitting. It may do more if an enemy doesn't seem to notice you. Strength acts the opposite: more damage, but less chance of hitting. Speech lets you talk to your foes, as you are able to get out of fighting some of them. The Heal button up top will restore your health. Press forward to enter the dungeon, and good luck!"
